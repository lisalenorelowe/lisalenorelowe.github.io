Experienced RCD professionals are not looking through the help wanted ads. They don't need you, you need them!  Here are some tips on convincing them to apply.

      <h5>Got Performance Metrics?</h5>
      <h6>Using the annual review process to assess corporate culture.</h6>
      <p>How do you define performance metrics for a team of abstract impressionist painters?  I don’t know either, but this is IT.  Metrics abound.  A company’s annual review form can reveal their top priorities, allowing you to decide whether your values align with their vision; however, beware the company who pays lip service to equity without creating policies to protect it.  Performance reviews cannot be equitable without standardized performance metrics.</p>

      <h5>The RCD Unicorn</h5>
      <h6>Wanted: RCD Unicorn. Preferred qualifications: Everything and the kitchen sink.</h6>
      <p>Universities everywhere have been earmarking funds for new staff positions to facilitate Research Computing and Data.  By creating job postings with a laundry list of superhuman qualifications, we perpetuate a lack of diversity, increase the workload of existing staff, and set up our new hires for failure.  Creating new staff positions at cash-strapped universities is often a once in a lifetime opportunity...let's make it count!</p>
