<h2 class="text-thin" style="font-size:24px">Could this be true??</h2>

I'm a bit of a recluse and tend to avoid group events like the plague. Actually, our last plague, (COVID), made it possible to never leave my house for 2 years without anyone asking me to check my meds. I loved it. 
</p>

<p style="color:white; font-size:18px">
Anyway, I hadn't talked to anyone in my local AAUW branch for quite a while when I scanned the news and saw a <i>mugshot</i> of our former President next to an article with a shocking title.  (It was scandalous enough that I’m uncomfortable sharing the link.  I think you’ll get the gist of it...)
</p>

<p style="color:white; font-size:18px">
I thought…I don't know Treka <i>that</i> well, but…really? REALLY?? But who knows! Treka could be a serial killer for all I know. Another good reason for me never to leave the house…
</p>

<p style="color:white; font-size:18px">
Then I started carefully reading the article. I had to read it several times, and also checked several times whether it was really WRAL or if someone hacked Facebook. Let's start examining this, shall we?
</p>

<p style="color:white; font-size:18px">
When a grandparent gets custody of a child while the mother is still living, that often indicates a serious issue with the mother. There are exceptions of course, like that one dad who left his kid with Grandpa to be an astronaut and save the world. (Wait…do <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)" target="_blank"><u>movies</u></a></b> count?)
</p>

<p style="color:white; font-size:18px">
So Treka's ole mugshot was on the TV news! We don't watch TV news, but my partner Mike has a friend Mike who watches constantly and he was <i>railing</i> on how some horrible lady abused their poor autistic kid. My Mike had already heard the story from me, and said, "that was a <i>grandmother</i>, who got <i>custody</i>, and that's what the <i>mother</i> is saying now". Mike's Mike replied, "Oh? <i>Ohhhh!</i> Poor grandmother." He knows that story too.
</p>

<h2 class="text-thin" style="font-size:24px">Could this be me?</h2>
<p style="color:white; font-size:18px">
Now let's talk about word choice and cooking. 'To pour' is a <i>very</i> different verb than 'to spill'. Spill, splash, have something inadvertently fly out of your hand, all very different than 'pour'. For example, I have frequently spilled, but never poured, hot coffee in my lap.  Luckily, I have two calm and quiet daughters who have <i>never</i> run through the kitchen for any reason, let alone do so while I'm cooking. And that's good, because I've splattered grease, dropped hot pans, and flung knives across the floor, (I swear, by accident), each time thanking God no one was nearby.

My youngest daughter has a super-high pain tolerance. Once when she was about 4, I took her to the pediatrician because after two weeks, her cough wasn’t going away. She was happy, playing, seemingly fine, but the cough was just hanging on too long, so I made that appointment. The doctor looked in her ear, then glared at me in horror and disgust, "You only just brought her in <i>now</i>?!? She has a <i>raging</i> ear infection!" Like…don't most kids tug their ears and cry for that? Not my kiddo. And guess what? Ten years later, I took her to urgent care because she had a cough. (I only waited two days this time). The PA tells me everything is fine and I shouldn’t worry so much. After looking in her ear, she said, “when she was little, did she have a shunt put in her ear to drain fluid?” Ummm, no…why? “There's some scarring, typical of that”. Well, guess what? The scarring had to be from that ear infection 10 years ago. My kid is <i>permanently scarred</i> because I refused to provide timely medical care.

<h2 class="text-thin" style="font-size:24px">Let's stop this</h2>
<p style="color:white; font-size:18px">
In my view, the only way that article didn't qualify as libel is that the reporter simply quotes the attorney. This is another unfortunate, but ubiquitous, problem in 'journalism' today. A summary: The title of that article was shocking and guaranteed to provoke emotion, a very effective way to shut down critical thinking skills. A reader's assumption the title describes a factual event creates an 'anchoring effect': initial information drives our subsequent judgments. Finally, we have the 'framing effect': the tendency to draw different conclusions from the same information, depending on how that information is presented. The <i>reporter</i> isn't claiming these things are true, they are simply reporting on what was said. Thus, we are responsible for our own conclusions. Please call this out, every time you see it, and don't let it ruin someone's life.

If this was just some nuisance social media attack, we could take a deep breath with a glass of wine and try to laugh it off.  But these are real charges, being taken seriously by our legal system. Our Treka was dragged from her home and thrown in jail.  She is facing two felonies and serious jail time. Realize, if this could happen to her, it could happen to me, to anyone, and I find that terrifying.
</p>
<br>
<h2 class="text-thin" style="font-size:24px">We need your help</h2>
<p style="color:white; font-size:18px">
Treka needs legal counsel, and it’s expensive.  It costs almost $1000 just for an attorney to draft a will, and Treka needs to fight two felony charges.  I think that most of us do not have large sums of money to give away, no matter what the cause. (I already spent mine on that will, and some steel-toed boots for the kitchen. And my meds. No, but seriously...) Since we don’t have large donors, we need your small donation.  And your friend’s small donation.  And your friend’s friend’s…

Please help if you can, and please forward this request.

Are you hesitant, because she might be guilty?  Remember…she <i>could</i> be a serial killer!  I personally don’t believe that, but I <i>also</i> think it shouldn’t matter; everyone is entitled to a fair defense. Please help us get her that by <b><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-pay-the-price-to-prove-innocence" target="_blank"><u>making a donation</u></a></b> and spreading the word.
